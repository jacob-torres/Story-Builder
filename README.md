# Story-Builder
A simple Django web application for organizing the plot structure of a story.

## How It Works

The story builder starts with the smallest building blocks of a story: ideas.

An idea can be a fully-edited scene, a provocative sentence, an inspiring image, or even a single word.

Using these ideas -- big and small -- a writer will be able to craft a sketch of their story's plot.

## Project Background

Story telling is part of what makes us human. Stringing together places, people, and events to communicate a theme or message is as old as humanity itself.

Those of us who craft fiction stories are often confronted with the difficulties of organizing our ideas into coherent and consumable stories. This is because some stories are too premature and raw to know what to do with at first.

## Story Building Process

Each story is treated as a collection of scenes, which are themselves collections of ideas. It is possible to have a story with a single scene, which in turn contains a single idea, though most compelling stories will need more.
