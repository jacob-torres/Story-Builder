# Story-Builder
A simple Django web application for organizing the plot structure of a story.

## How It Works

The story builder starts with the smallest building blocks of a story: ideas.

An idea can be a fully-edited scene, a provocative sentence, an inspiring image, or even a single word.

Using these ideas -- big and small -- a writer will be able to craft a sketch of their story's plot.
